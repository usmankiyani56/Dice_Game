Welcome to the React Dice Game project! This application offers a digital adaptation of the classic dice game, providing users with an engaging and entertaining experience. Here's an overview of the key features and components of this project:

MainPage Component: The MainPage component serves as the entry point for users. It presents a visually appealing interface with the game's title and an option to start playing the game by clicking the "Play Game" button.

GamePage Component: Once the user clicks the "Play Game" button, they are directed to the GamePage component. This component displays the game board, including the current score, a selection of numbers to choose from, and an interactive dice image. Users can click on a number to make a guess and then roll the dice to see if their guess matches the rolled number.

Button Component: The Button component is a reusable UI element used throughout the application to create interactive buttons. It accepts onClick and text props to customize button behavior and appearance.

Rules Component: The Rules component provides users with instructions on how to play the dice game. It explains the gameplay mechanics, including selecting a number, rolling the dice, and earning or deducting points based on the guess.

App Component: The main App component manages the application's state and controls the flow between the MainPage and GamePage components. It utilizes React's useState hook to toggle between the two pages based on whether the game has started.

The project showcases the power and versatility of React for building interactive web applications. Whether you're a seasoned player or new to dice games, this project offers a fun and enjoyable experience for all users.
